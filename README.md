# SQL-Project-Famous-Painting

## Project Overview
let us work on an SQL Case study in which we shall download a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings) and then upload it to a PostgreSQL database using Python.  We shall then analyze the data and solve 20+ SQL queries. You can term this SQL practice exercise as an SQL project or an SQL case study. The aim is to provide you with a dataset to analyze data and then practice basic to intermediate SQL problems.

## Data Source

Dataset downloaded from [Kaggle/Famous paintings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings)
* We will be working with Total of 8 CSV files and all file size will be 7mb.

# Connecting to PostgreSQL
![postgres-logo](https://github.com/Clintonnick3/SQL-Project-Famous-Painting-/assets/129974527/507dabfa-ad55-4625-bd8c-0f59cb1fc9ce)
PostgreSQL  is an open-source, highly stable database system that provides support to different functions of SQL, like foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, and different user-defined types and functions.
* To check the authentication and connecting parameters I used **PGADMIN4** and even for quering purpose also.
* Python scripts for initiating connection between dataframe and database [FOR THE CODE CLICK ME.](https://github.com/Clintonnick3/SQL-Project-Famous-Painting-/blob/main/paint.py)
* Authenticating servers, creating database, creating tables and migrating datas from pandas dataframe to postgreSQL database.
* Module which I have used is **SQLALCHEMY** and **CREATE_ENGINE** and we can use other module is **PSYCOPG2**.
